# Neural-Network-Covid-19-Pneumonia-Detection--ct-scan-images-by-tensorflow

In this Project I’ve used tensorflow to train a neural network model for detecting Covid 19 / Pneumonia / normal people , from ct scan images. The source code is available on google colab because of the huge dataset and computations that use gpu.
